The system proposed in this report is an advanced solution for monitoring temperature at particular place which will raise an alert as soon as temperature goes beyond certain range. The technology behind this is cloud computing, Internet of Things which is an advanced and efficient solution for connecting the entire world of things in a network. The systems deals with monitoring and controlling environmental condition like temperature with sensors and send this information to cloud. The data updated from the current reading can be used to generate an e-alert if the temperature goes beyond certain limit. The proposed system may be used in the situation where fire can cause damage to the computers and may effect on user’s current work. This system may be useful in maintaining user’s integrity by automatically terminating the current transactions. Firebase real time database can be used to monitor the temperature conditions. Moreover, an alert message notification was implemented in Android application so that a user is notified whenever the temperature reading reaches the preset threshold. On the other hand, the smart chair system has brilliant commercial prospects, which can be helpful to build health care products with the help of wearable sensors, intelligent refrigerator/oven temperature tracking system and etc.
